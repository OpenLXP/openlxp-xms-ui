            <p className='mb-2'>
              One major benefit of a Defense-wide learning ecosystem is the
              availability and accessibility of instructional resources from across
              the agency. However, with hundreds of DoD organizations currently
              using a wide variety of methods to describe and publish these
              resources, there are now thousands of proprietary and disconnected
              catalog capabilities across the enterprise, many of them hard to find
              or even know they exist.
            </p>
            <p className='pb-4 mb-2'>
              Existing course catalogs are not designed to easily transfer data
              about learning activities between the different DoD systems. Catalogs
              integrated into proprietary platforms use pre-determined,
              point-to-point connections to transfer data between systems, requiring
              lengthy integration efforts for each connected system. Many systems
              cannot accommodate new and emerging types of learning activities –
              such as e-books, mobile device learning augmented reality, or
              simulations – and they fail to provide insight into the learning
              activities that comprise each course. Current course catalogs also use
              sparse, non-standard metadata to describe their courses, which limits
              the ability to share resources across DoD components, and identify
              course duplication.

            <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold'>About the Project</h2>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              The ECC uses a metadata curation service to automatically generate
              metadata from different pools of information stored within the catalog
              owner’s local network. For example, DAU requires students to complete
              a course survey at the end of each course. These data are stored in
              DAU’s data warehouse and might be used to drive a course’s aggregate
              rating, which is a common feature found in most commercial course
              catalogs.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              The automated metadata service provided by ECC facilitates the
              alignment of metadata across organizations and helps maintain
              up-to-date information in the ECC. The metadata can also be used to
              align learning activities (e.g., courses, instructional materials)
              with standardized data on careers, competencies, and credentials. This
              kind of data alignment is a key element of DoD’s Enterprise Digital
              Learning Modernization (EDLM) data strategy.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              The ECC includes several subsystems that enable the discoverability
              and accessibility of all DoD instructional activities. The ADL
              Initiative is focused on building, integrating, testing, and deploying
              the services and systems required to enable this ECC vision.

              In July 2018, the DoD Chief Management Officer (CMO) and the Reform
              Management Group formally initiated the EDLM reform initiative. The
              goal of the EDLM effort is to build an enterprise-wide integrated
              digital learning ecosystem that enables efficient acquisition and
              spending management for DoD education and training products and
              services. The ECC is one of the three EDLM lines of effort.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              In July 2020, the ADL Initiative developed an ECC Pre-Alpha Prototype
              to validate the architectural approach for course catalog federation
              and to collect data about existing course catalog structures. Courses
              from Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Defense Acquisition
              University (DAU), and Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) were
              integrated into a common catalog portal powered by an open-source
              search and analytics engine (ElasticSearch) and visualization platform
              (Kibana).
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2'>
              In September 2020, the ADL Initiative kicked off the development of an
              operational Minimum Viable Product (MVP) ECC capability. The MVP will
              be scalable to support the global search and discovery of available
              courses within the ≈300 schoolhouses distributed across the DoD.
            </p>
            <p className='pb-4 mb-2'>
              Benefits of the ECC will include a broader, faster, and simplified
              capability to identify and access digital learning resources and
              opportunities across the DoD, and cost savings and cost avoidance
              through reduced duplication of courses and content.
